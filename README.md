# FocusStake - Gamified Web3 Focus Protocol

Welcome to **FocusStake**, a revolutionary productivity app that uses economic incentives to boost personal focus and fight procrastination. Built with Next.js and GoFr backend, this application combines the Pomodoro technique with blockchain staking to create a powerful psychological motivator for productivity.

## ðŸŽ¯ Concept

FocusStake transforms focus into a game with real economic stakes. Users stake cryptocurrency to start focus sessions, and if they successfully complete the session (verified by avoiding distracting websites), they get their stake back plus rewards. If they fail, their stake is forfeited to the reward pool for others to win.

## ðŸš€ How It Uses Sponsor Technologies

### BlockDAG
The core of the app. Smart contracts on BlockDAG manage:
- Staking mechanism for focus sessions
- Reward distribution from the collective pool
- Verification logic for session completion
- Automatic stake forfeiture for failed sessions

### Verbwire
Makes the experience engaging through:
- Non-transferable NFT badges for focus streaks (e.g., "10-Hour Focus Master," "7-Day Streak")
- Easy minting of achievement NFTs
- Integration with wallet management for staking

### Akash Network
Hosts personalized AI that:
- Analyzes focus patterns and productivity trends
- Suggests optimal times of day for focus sessions
- Recommends session lengths based on user behavior
- Provides personalized productivity insights

### GoFr
The backend service that:
- Manages user accounts and authentication
- Communicates with BlockDAG smart contracts
- Tracks focus session data and statistics
- Handles reward calculations and distributions

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result.
